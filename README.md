# password-hashing-LABS

A simple password hashing PBKDF2 / SCRYPT Python Implementation for educational purposes only.


It also executes a basic password strength test (not fancy at all, a pretty basic one).


Not suitable for production in terms of SQL database query sanitization/optimization/auth. There's no documentation within the code. Goal is to demonstrate password hashing implementation instead
of clear text or pure hash storage.
