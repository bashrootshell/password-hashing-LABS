# password-hashing-LABS

### This is a simple password hashing _PBKDF2 / SCRYPT / ARGON2 Python Implementation_ for educational purposes only, and it has been used by my computer science undergrad students.


It also executes a basic password strength test (not fancy at all, a pretty basic one).


**Not suitable for production in terms of SQL _database query sanitization/optimization/auth_.The only goal is to demonstrate password hashing implementation instead of a clear text implementation or even a 'pure hash' storage. There's no documentation within the code.**
